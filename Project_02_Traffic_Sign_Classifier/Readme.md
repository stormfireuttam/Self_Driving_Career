# Project 2 - Traffic Sign Classification

The goal of this project was to build a CNN in TensorFlow to classify traffic sign images from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

Main steps covered in this project are:
- Dataset exploration and visualization
- Data augmentation
- Deep network design and training
- Visualization of the certainty/uncertainty of the model's predictions
