# Project 1 - Finding Lane Lines on the Road

This is an intermediate Python project in machine learning, which is helpful for the data science aspirants to master machine learning and gain expertise.

In this lane line detection project, we use OpenCV. Before detecting lane lines, we masked remaining objects and then identified the line with Hough transformation.

The goal of this first project was to create a simple pipeline to detect road lines in a frame taken from a roof-mounted camera.

***Category: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision***

**Programming Language: Python**

**Tools & Libraries: OpenCV**

**IDE: Google Colab**

**Front End: NA**

**Back End: Python**

**Prerequisites: Python, Machine Learning**

**Intended Audience**: Education, Developers, Data Scientists, AI professionals

Being the very first project, the pipeline is necessarily very simple. No machine learning is involved - just computer vision and a lot of boring manual parameter tuning. :-)
